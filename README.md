## Project Description
Project Description: Online Chatbot-based Ticket Booking Application

This project is a web-based ticket booking platform developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) integrated with a Dialogflow-powered chatbot.

Key Features:

Clean UI: The platform boasts a visually appealing, user-friendly interface, designed for easy navigation and a smooth booking experience.
Search Filter: Users can filter their search results by categories such as event type, location, date, and price, improving efficiency in finding the right ticket.
Dialogflow Trained Chatbot: The chatbot, powered by Dialogflow, assists users with booking tickets by answering queries, making recommendations, and handling common customer support issues.
